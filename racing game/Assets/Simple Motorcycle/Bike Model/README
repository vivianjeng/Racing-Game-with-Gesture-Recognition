HARAKIRI WARBIKE (CC-BY-SA 3.0+)

The model was modelled in MisfitModel 3D (mm3d) within some hours.
Texturing is just improvised using some foto-textures and texture-projections.
The model is provided in several formats.

Vertices: 975
Faces: 1670

About half of the budget is in the wheels.
There are some hidden polygons which may be spared.

The model lacks:

- breaks
- instruments
- lights
- windshield
- driver

...it's a harakiri freestyle bike.

Feel free to make additions, variations and ehancements.
